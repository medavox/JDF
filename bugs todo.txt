MouseEvents can't be properly listened for by sprites (ie in an array of button-likes), 
because they have no swing corporeal form, and are not 'added' to their parent  container; 
thus they can't be clicked on, so don't receive MouseEvents for that reason as well.
need a stage which updates only when a triggered event is captured - chess doesn't need 30fps
