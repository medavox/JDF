Java Display Framework
======================

Intended to be a general-purpose "display framework", akin to ActionScript's Display package.

Likely to be helpful to ex-ActionScript developers who have moved into Java, and Java games (and other custom-graphical software) developers who want a lightweight framework which handles the nitty-gritty of custom graphics.

  * Has its own implementations for graphical objects with x, y and rotation properties (Sprites)
  * Provides a Stage, which displays and manages all graphical objects below it
  * Allows Sprites to hold sub-sprites (children)

This is a work-in-progress, and functionality will be added as I need it, when using this library in my own projects.

In the meantime, feel free to fork, contribute, and improve it.
